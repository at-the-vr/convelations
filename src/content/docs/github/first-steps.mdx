## Use the Framework

An important prerequisite, try the product and see how I like it. I watched couple of tutorials for quick onboarding, read through [Build your first Astro Blog](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) and that's it, I am sold to Astro's goal. I have previously dabbled with React and VueJs but Astro's [Easy to Use](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#easy-to-use) Model hit me like a truck.

## Documentation

Reading Docs can be a cumbersome process, so I made my constraints. Read what I like, and use what I like. This only helps me filter out most stuff until Twitter does its thing and shows me what Astro can do that I have not seen anywhere.
