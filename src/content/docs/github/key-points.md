## What I uphold

1. **Using GitHub Issues and GitHub Discussions**

   Found an Issue in a GitHub Project? Raise it _(Minblowing I know)_. Found a
   cool feature to integrate? `Issues` is your place. There are times when
   Maintainers will ask you to move the conversation to GitHub Discussions and
   that's good since that allows other maintainers & developers to share their solutions.

2. **What after Hacktoberfest**

   I have been active during Hacktoberfest since last year but this year, I found
   a community where I can learn and contribute to their repos. I understood what
   their goals were and found excitement for their projects. Now my contributions
   tend to solve their Issues & my subjective feedback brings a different perspective
   to their PRs.

3. **Anxiety around Pull Requests**

   I used to assume my PRs would be immediately reviewed & merged. That led to
   inevitable delays in delivery. The key thing about PRs is that they can be improved
   with reviews & new commits. Say, I am translating a page in my language of choice:
   I can precisely commit my changes and spend way too much time & effort on that Issue
   only for it to find some errors by the maintainers `or` I can rapidly translate,
   commit/push, create a PR, have it reviewed and updated.
