## What I uphold

1. **Using GitHub Issues and GitHub Discussions**

    Found an Issue in a GitHub Project? Raise it (_Minblowing I know_). Found a
    cool feature to integrate? Issues is your place. There are times when
    Maintainers will ask you to move the conversation to GitHub Discussions and
    that's good since that allows other maintainers to share their solutions.

2. **What after Hacktoberfest**

    I have been active during Hacktoberfest since last year but this year, I found
    a community where I can learn and contribute to their repos. I understood what
    their Goals are and found an excitement for their projects and how my contributions
    tend to solve their Issues.
