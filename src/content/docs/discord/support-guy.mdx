## Couple of things

1. I am not the only guy for "support", there are over 25 thousand members with an average of 4k active members at any time on Astro Lounge. Anyone can answer queries there asynchronously.
2. This is a volunteer role, none of support-squad perform this activity for financial benefits.
3. I am not a maestro in Astro, but what I get to know from my day to day interaction within Astro Ecosystem is what helps me in diagnosing atleast 1 support Issue per week.

## What type of Support Issue are you talking about ?

Any kind: Having difficulty initiating astro projects, trouble with package installations, mismatch configurations with CSS and Tailwind and recently Icon management with Astro-Icon. There is a plethora of issues that are taken care by support-squad as well as kapa-ai on a daily basis and I have no words for that.

## Don't you have any Support Issues ?

Ofcourse I do ðŸ˜… and I share them in appropriate channels for fast and effective response. No matter how simple it can be, there's always someone to diagnose my Issues as well. Timezone can be a pain to deal with, and I resort to any method possible to mitigate that effect.
