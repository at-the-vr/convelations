Discord is my most used Application.

[Astro Lounge](https://discord.gg/astrodotbuild) is where I get to know stuff
about Astro alongside [**Astro Docs**](https://docs.astro.build/) &
[**Starlight Docs**](https://starlight.astro.build/).

## What I hold

1. **Ask and type your queries instead of begging maintainers for a quick 1 on 1.**

   Instead of pursuing maintainers for diagnosing your issues verbally, have them
   atleast know about your queries in form of text messages. That ensures an asynchronous
   procedure and presents opportunities for other Maintainers & Developers to chime
   in as well.

2. **Use dedicated channel and/or a thread for your Discussions.**

   _#general_ is certainly not the place to ask for reviewing your PRs, pushing
   down large code snippets & asking for diagnosis _but_, incase there's a need then
   Discord allows users to create [Threads](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423-Threads-FAQ#h_01F99Z9HJEBXXK8JJ45SZAE0FC) in order to reduce the
   _wall of text_ effect and the thread can be referred by new members as well
   for similar queries.

3. **Acquaintance with Discord Markdown**

   I always find it easy to read when text messages are formatted especially code
   snippets. I usually refer to this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/matthewzring/9f7bbfd102003963f9be7dbcf7d40e51)
   by Matthew.
