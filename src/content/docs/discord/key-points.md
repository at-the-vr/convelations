Discord is my most used Application.

[Astro Lounge](https://discord.gg/astrodotbuild) is where I get to know stuff about Astro alongside [**Astro Docs**](https://docs.astro.build/) & [**Starlight Docs**](https://starlight.astro.build/).

## What I uphold

1. **Ask and type your queries instead of begging maintainers for a quick 1 on 1.**

   Instead of pursuing maintainers for diagnosing your issues verbally, have them at least know about your queries in the form of text messages. That ensures an asynchronous procedure and presents opportunities for other Maintainers & developers to chime in as well.

2. **Use a dedicated channel and/or a thread for your Discussions.**

   _#general_ is certainly not the place to ask for reviewing your PRs, pushing down large code snippets & getting them diagnosed but, in case there's a need Discord allows users to create [Threads](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423-Threads-FAQ#h_01F99Z9HJEBXXK8JJ45SZAE0FC) to reduce the _wall of text_ effect and the thread can later be _referred_ by new members as well for similar queries.

3. **Acquaintance with Discord Markdown**

   I always find it easy to read when text messages are formatted, especially code snippets. I usually refer to this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/matthewzring/9f7bbfd102003963f9be7dbcf7d40e51) by Matthew.
