import Figure from '../../../components/Figure.astro';

Me casually minding my own business and then boom!! Found someone in discord playing around the Server Rules

Its something I am guilty off not following couple of times. The fact that I am **not** a Server Admin let alone a Moderator should suffice that I have no rights to enforce a non-existent authority on any server member.

What does that leaves me With? Ignore it.

That's right, Ignoring is an excellent move for a person like me. I can A. try and calm the situation (which is something I am bad at) _OR_ B. let an actual Mod do their role.
