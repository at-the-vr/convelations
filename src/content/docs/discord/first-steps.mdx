## Finding favorite channels

The important thing here is to get myself acquainted with all the channels and find the ones I wanna take part in. This includes discussing with other members & maintainers, asking my doubts about their Project, and sometimes diagnosing issues faced by developers. Eventually, I can branch out to other channels and find more topics of interest.

## Finding events

Open-source communities like Astro, Nuxt regularly organize community calls which are virtual meets with the Core Team and server members. Places like these are best to network and engage with the Team. The Team gets to showcase their achievements in past weeks and I get the first chance to try their features.

## Engaging with folks

Having some feedback is better than none. If I like someone's project I will let them know and if I think it can be improved, I tell them that as well.
