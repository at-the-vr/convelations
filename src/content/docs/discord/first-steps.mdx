## Finding favorite channels

The important thing here is to get myself acquainted with all the channels and
find the ones I wanna take part in. This includes discussing with other members &
maintainers, asking my doubts about their Project, and sometimes diagnosing different
issues faced by developers. Eventually, I can branch out to other channels and 
find more topics of interest.

## Finding events

Open-source communities like Astro, Nuxt regularly organize community calls which are
virtual meets with the Core Team and the Discord members. Places like these are the
best to network and engage with the Team. The Team gets to showcase their achievements
in past weeks and I get the first chance to try their features.

## Engaging with folks

I used to feel judgemental whenever I typed my messages to anyone on Discord. The
thing is it's all part of a learning process. Having some feedback is better than
none. If I like someone's project I will let them know and if I think it can be improved,
I tell them that as well.
