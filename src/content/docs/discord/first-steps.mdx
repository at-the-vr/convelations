These are steps I followed in my time around [Astro Lounge](https://discord.gg/astrodotbuild).

## Finding events

Open-source communities like Astro, Nuxt regularly organize community calls which are
virtual meets with the Core Team and the Discord members. Places like these are the
best to network and engage with the Team. The Team gets to showcase their achievements
in past weeks and I get the first chance to try their features.

## Finding favorite channels

The important thing here is to get myself acquainted with all the channels and
find the ones I wanna take part in. This includes discussing with other members &
maintainers, asking my doubts about their Project, and learning in the process.
Eventually, I can branch out to other channels and find more topics of interest.
